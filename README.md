Project 1: Spreadsheets, Java APPS SCRIPT
## [Netflix movie selector on Gooogle Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bh14ZlDO7N9Ilnb3h-bfHI9-JtoOqlaZF9FuSMrtVPY/edit?usp=sharing )

This Project is a simple spreadsheet I've created starting from public dataset [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)
The final result is an organized file with 4 tab:
* SELECTOR  :  page with 2 button connected with Java APPS SCRIPT, one to select a random movie and the other to clean the page
* FILTRED DATASET  :  page with 3 dropdown filters connected to a query
* stats  :  page with simple analysis of the dataset
* netflix_titles.csv  :  the original dataset

Project 2: BI tools, SQL, BigQuery
## [Austin Bike Rentals from 2014](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/27d28d6a-0f3b-4024-9c12-7736f158c28e/page/g6clD)

This Project is a Dashboard I've developed starting from public Google dataset [austin_bikesharing.austin_biketrips]
* First I've used BigQuery to connect the dataset to Looker Studion
* In the First page I've added a brief explanation of the dataset with static charts that show the number of trips and the number of trips considering the bike's type 
* In the second page we have the Dashboard with filters to analize the Market trends
* With SQL language I've created the calculation field
