### Project 1: BI tools, SQL, BigQuery

This Project is a Dashboard I've developed starting from public Google dataset [austin_bikesharing.austin_biketrips]
* First I've used BigQuery to connect the dataset to Looker Studion
* In the First page I've added a brief explanation of the dataset with static charts that show the number of trips and the number of trips considering the bike's type 
* In the second page we have the Dashboard with filters to analize the Market trends
* With SQL language I've created the calculation field
